    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the flour, milk, eggs, butter, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Brush the pan with a small amount of butter or oil.</li>
                <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of the crepe batter into the pan, tilting the pan to spread the batter evenly. Cook the crepe for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges start to brown and the crepe is set.</li>
                <li>Flip the crepe and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until the other side is lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Transfer the crepe to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter, brushing the pan with butter or oil as needed.</li>
